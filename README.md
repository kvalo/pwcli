# pwcli - a script for applying patches from patchwork and sending summary emails

## Introduction

`pwcli` is script which I wrote to ease my kernel maintainer duties.
It provides a simple readline interface for accessing patches in a
patchwork servers over Patchwork's REST API, uses git to commit the
patches to a local repository and send emails using an SMTP server.
The benefit from the script is that it doesn't matter if you apply one
or hundred patches, it's still the same amount of work for you (unless
there are conflicts, of course).

This still a prototype but it already helps me to avoid tedious manual
work and manage patches faster. All feedback very welcome:

At the same pwcli also opened the patchwork page on my browser:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11507425/ 

There I could check if the patch has received any comments and review
the patch myself. And also after the commit did a build check for me
and after I had accepted the patch it changed the state on the server
and sent a "thank you" email to notify the submitter the patch is
applied:

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200428084448.7D63BC433F2@smtp.codeaurora.org

Even though here I just installed one patch, I could do the same for a
patch series. For example, I had wanted to apply the ath9k patchset
with 6 patches I would have just issued:

```
master@wireless-drivers-next > commit 5-10
```

Otherwise the number of patches doesn't make a difference and a
similar email would have been sent as a response to the first patch.

## Installation

pwcli requires python3 and these packages (newer versions should work
but of course you never know):


```
ii  python3              3.5.1-3              interactive high-level object-oriented language
ii  python3-requests     2.9.1-3ubuntu0.1     elegant and simple HTTP library for Python3
ii  git                  1:2.7.4-0ubuntu1.9   fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
ii  diffstat             1.61-1               produces graph of changes introduced by a diff file
```

To install pwcli just to copy the script somewhere in your $PATH:

```
cp pwcli /usr/local/bin/
```

pwcli needs a configuration file in `.git/pwcli/config` in the git
repository you are working on. Here's a simple example using
kernel.org's linux-wireless project just for downloading patches:


```
[general]
server-url = https://patchwork.kernel.org/
project = linux-wireless
```

And here's my config file I use for maintaining kernel trees:

```
[general]
server-url = https://patchwork.kernel.org/
project = linux-wireless
username = edward
token = abcd123456789890
browser = xdg-open
build-command = make -j 8
automatic-emails = true
msgid-tag = Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/%s
```

For more information about the configuration options see pwcli.conf.

For emails pwcli uses git configuration variables, so you want to make
sure they are correctly set:

```
git config user.name 'Edward Example'
git config user.email 'edward@example.com'
git config sendemail.smtpserver smtp.example.com
git config sendemail.smtpserverport 587
git config sendemail.smtpuser edward
git config sendemail.smtppass 1234567890
git config sendemail.smtpencryption tls
```

## Patch check scripts

pwcli supports having external patch check scripts, for example
testing Signed-off-by or Fixes tags in commit logs. They are installed
to .git/pwcli/check.d directory and need to be executable, otherwise
the script is ignored. pwcli feads the patch to the script via stdin
in mbox format and the script outputs any warnings either via stdout
or stderr. pwcli then shows the warnings to the user. If there's no
output from the script it's assumed there were no warnings. Scripts
exit value is ignored.

## Tests

There are various automatic tests for pwcli, use `run_tests` to run
them all. These are currently run on Ubuntu 16.04 with these packages
(the list might not be complete):

```
$ dpkg -l cmdtest figlet pycodestyle pyflakes3 python3-flask-restful python3-mock python3-pexpect
ii  cmdtest               0.32.14.gcdfe14e-2 all          blackbox testing of Unix command line programs
ii  figlet                2.2.5-3+b1         amd64        Make large character ASCII banners out of ordinary text
ii  pycodestyle           2.6.0-1            all          Python style guide checker (formerly called pep8)
ii  pyflakes3             2.2.0-2            all          passive checker of Python 3 programs
ii  python3-flask-restful 0.3.8-5            all          REST API framework for Flask applications (Python3 Module)
ii  python3-mock          4.0.3-1            all          Mocking and Testing Library (Python3 version)
ii  python3-pexpect       4.8.0-2            all          Python 3 module for automating interactive applications
ii  python3-aiosmtpd      1.4.3-1.1          all          Python3 asyncio based SMTP server
